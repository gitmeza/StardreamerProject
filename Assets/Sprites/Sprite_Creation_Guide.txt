# Simple Sprite Creation Instructions

Since we can't create actual image files through text, here's how to create the basic sprites in Unity:

## Method 1: Using Unity's Built-in Sprites

1. **Player Ship Sprite:**
   - Right-click in Project window > Create > 2D > Sprites > Square
   - Name it "PlayerShip"
   - In the Sprite Editor, modify to look like a triangle pointing up
   - Set color to bright blue (#00BFFF)

2. **Enemy Ship Sprites:**
   - Create multiple square sprites
   - Name them "EnemyShip1", "EnemyShip2", "EnemyShip3"
   - Modify shapes to look like different enemy ships
   - Set colors to red (#FF0000), orange (#FFA500), yellow (#FFFF00)

3. **Bullet Sprites:**
   - Create small square sprites
   - Name them "PlayerBullet" and "EnemyBullet"
   - Make them small rectangles
   - Set colors to white (#FFFFFF) for player bullets, red (#FF0000) for enemy bullets

## Method 2: Using Simple Colored Rectangles

For now, you can use Unity's default white square sprites and just change their colors in the SpriteRenderer component.

## Method 3: Create Custom Sprites

1. Go to Assets > Create > 2D > Sprites > Square
2. Select the sprite in the Project window
3. In the Inspector, click "Sprite Editor"
4. Use the editing tools to modify the shape
5. Save and apply changes

## Quick Setup for Testing

For immediate testing, you can:
1. Use Unity's default white square sprites
2. Set different colors in the SpriteRenderer components
3. Scale them appropriately (Player: 0.5x0.5, Enemies: 0.4x0.4, Bullets: 0.1x0.1)
